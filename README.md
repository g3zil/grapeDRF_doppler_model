# Installation 
This software has been tested on Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS systems.

### Download
You need to clone the package from github.com and run the software in the grapeDRF_doppler_model sub-directory. 
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/g3zil/grapeDRF_doppler_model.git
cd ~/grapeDRF_doppler_model
```
Execute all further commands in the ~/grapeDRF_doppler_model directory.
Updates can be downloaded with:
```
git pull
```

## Requirements
### Open environment
Install the dependencies in requirements.txt:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This code has been tested with python 3.10.16 in clean conda virtual environments on Mac OS 15.3.1 and Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5 LTS. It has also been tested with python 3.10.14 on Mac OS 10.14.6.

### Externally managed environment
The code is the same but the modules installation requires extra steps. It has been tested with python 3.12.3 on Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS. A virtual environment is created and activated in the directory ~/grapeDRF_doppler_model/.venv, the latest version of pip is installed, and the required modules installed.
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Synthetic spectrogram scripts
The synthetic spectrogram scripts (see below) require the ray tracing package PyLap to be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/HamSCI/PyLap). 
Note that as of September 2025 PyLap only assuredly works with PHaRLAP 4.5.0. There may be issues with its setup.sh in a protected environment.

# W2NAF Eclipse Plotting
To make a plot, run:
```
python plot_w2naf_grapeDRF_2024eclipse.py
```

This will automatically create an `output/` directory and the desired plot in `output/w2naf_2024eclipse/20240408.0000_20240409.0000_w2naf_WDgrape_20_15_10_5.png`.

# G3ZIL Doppler plotting and analysis
One-day data files for the examples below are in directories ./data/psws_grapeDRF/ch0_* where * is a PSWS reporting station callsign.
Current examples include: ch0_G4HZX, ch0_N8GA, ch0_W2NAF.
Plots are output to ./output/plots/* where * is the callsign, and csv data files to ./output/csv/*

### Listing metadata
To list the available metadata for a station the data channel name is the single command line argument, run:
```
python3 grape_digital_RF_metadata.py ch0_G4HZX
```
### Plotting a simple spectrogram
The script requires four command line arguments, channel name, frequency index (from the metadata) start and end times in hours UTC. 
For example, with frequency index 6 for 15 MHz between 8 and 13 UTC, run
```
python3 grape_fft_spectrogram.py ch0_G4HZX 6 8 13
```
### Time domain Doppler analysis using complex autocorrelation
The script plots time series of signal+noise (S+N)level, Doppler shift and frequency spread.
The Doppler shift and spread estimates are only applicable where the spectrum is unimodal.
The same four command line arguments are required, run:
```
python3 grape_acf_doppler_spread.py ch0_G4HZX 6 8 14 
```
### Plot single interval spectrum, identifying N peaks
The script calculates a spectrum and fits Ricker wavelets with a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to identify peaks.
The four command line arguments are, channel name, frequency index, time of the spectrum in decimal hours and N the number of peaks to find, run:
```
python3 grape_fft_CWT_single_plot.py ch0_W2NAF 8 14.5 2
```
### Experimental multiple Doppler tracking
This script is under development and may fail with data-dependent errors. Two (July 2025) Dopppler spectrum peaks in each time interval are identified from CWF fits. A small training set where each peak is correctly assigned to one of the N propagation modes is used with a forecasting tool to predict the next value for set A. Whichever data value is closest to the prediction in the next interval is assigned to set A et seq. 
The script needs four command line arguments, channel name, frequency index, time of the spectrum in decimal hours and duration in minutes:
```
python3 grape_fft_CWT_tracking_prophet.py ch0_W2NAF 8 14.4 80
```
Here are the example plots, first the raw data and second the assigned to mode:
